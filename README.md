📘 Monkey Interpreter in C++

A C++ implementation of the interpreter from Writing an Interpreter in Go.

This project is a step-by-step, from-scratch recreation of the Monkey programming language interpreter described in Thorsten Ball’s book “Writing an Interpreter in Go” — but implemented entirely in C++.

The goal is just to create a simple compiler and achive one of life my life achievements...
	
The project follows the book’s structure closely, but adapts each chapter’s Go code into idiomatic C++17.
